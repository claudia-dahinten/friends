**An analysis of the sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S**

I am that person that you should avoid watching this TV Show with because I say all the lines before the characters. I am also the person who can’t hear the words ‘Oh My God’ without seeing Janice’s face and I also don’t think I’m capable of moving furniture without shouting ‘PIVOOOT’. I have the Friends poster in my room and I got the t-shirt too. Could I beeee any more obsessed?

When looking into possible Data Science side projects, it was therefore an easy decision to take a deeper look into my favourite TV show.

The data was scraped from the website: https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/ and I used Python and it’s various libraries to do the analysis.
